Bitwig browser random selection

## WARNING

This WILL lead to unexpected results, be sure to lower your volume before using.

## Motivation

I enjoy surprises, and I think that creativity comes from constraints.

So I wanted to make a script that would randomly select a Bitwig browser item.
This allows me two main things:
- Select unexpected items, which open up possibilities for me to explore.
- Force me to use a forgotten device, plugin… etc. to try to master it.

When used several times, I get a chain

## Activation

Copy the released extension to you bitwig extensions folder.

Activate it in the settings.

## Usage

This extension allows users to select a random item from the browser.
It could be any browser related item type, like device, plugin, wave file, preset, modulator…

Currently, it has tree buttons:
- `Select random item` opens a browser if none is already opened and selects a random item from the current opened browser.

- `Add current item` adds the current selected item.
  This is the same as `OK` in the browser.
  For me, it is convenient as it is close to the random button.

- `Surprise me!` is the same as the two others chained: opens the browser if none opened, selects a random item and adds it.
